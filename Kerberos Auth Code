## üîê **Kerberos Authentication Workflow Overview**

Kerberos is a secure method for authenticating a request for a service in a computer network. The key components involved are:

- **KDC (Key Distribution Center)** ‚Äì The domain controller offering authentication services.
    
- **TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket)** ‚Äì Initial ticket obtained upon successful logon.
    
- **ST (Service Ticket)** ‚Äì Ticket used to access specific network services.
    
- **SPN (Service Principal Name)** ‚Äì Unique identifier for each service in the domain.

## üßæ **Detailed Breakdown of Kerberos and Account-Related Event IDs**

---

### **4768 - A Kerberos authentication ticket (TGT) was requested**

- **Triggered When**: A user logs on or a machine starts up and requests a TGT from the KDC.
    
- **Key Fields**:
    
    - `Account Name`
        
    - `Client Address` (IP of requester)
        
    - `Ticket Encryption Type` (e.g., AES, RC4)
        
- **Security Use Case**:
    
    - Baseline logon patterns
        
    - Detect unusual logon sources or high frequency of TGT requests
        

---

### **4769 - A Kerberos service ticket was requested**

- **Triggered When**: A user with a valid TGT requests access to a service (e.g., file server).
    
- **Key Fields**:
    
    - `Service Name` (SPN requested)
        
    - `Client Address`
        
- **Security Use Case**:
    
    - Map lateral movement (e.g., mimikatz pass-the-ticket)
        
    - Detect unusual SPNs or high-volume ST requests
        

---

### **4770 - A Kerberos service ticket was renewed**

- **Triggered When**: A service ticket is renewed (valid for another time period).
    
- **Key Fields**:
    
    - `Renewed Ticket Encryption Type`
        
    - `Service Name`
        
- **Security Use Case**:
    
    - Rarely used in alerts but can track abnormal persistence of sessions
        

---

### **4771 - Kerberos pre-authentication failed**

- **Triggered When**: A user attempts to log on but fails at the pre-authentication stage.
    
- **Key Fields**:
    
    - `Failure Code` (e.g., 0x18 = bad password)
        
    - `Client Address`
        
- **Security Use Case**:
    
    - Detect brute-force attacks
        
    - Audit password failures from unexpected IPs
        

---

### **4772 - A Kerberos authentication ticket request failed**

- **Triggered When**: A TGT request fails (unlike 4771, this is post pre-auth).
    
- **Possible Causes**:
    
    - Time sync issues
        
    - Disabled/locked user
        
    - Account expired
        
- **Security Use Case**:
    
    - Track time-based attacks
        
    - Correlate with 4768/4769 for failed authentication chains
        

---

### **4773 - A Kerberos service ticket request failed**

- **Triggered When**: A user has a TGT but the request to access a service fails.
    
- **Common Reasons**:
    
    - SPN not found
        
    - Access denied
        
- **Security Use Case**:
    
    - Detect attempts to enumerate or access unauthorized services
        

---

## üë§ **Account Mapping & NTLM Validation Events**

---

### **4774 - An account was mapped for logon**

- **Triggered When**: A certificate is mapped to a user account (e.g., smart card).
    
- **Security Use Case**:
    
    - Validate successful certificate-based logons
        

---

### **4775 - An account could not be mapped for logon**

- **Triggered When**: A certificate could not be mapped to a user.
    
- **Common Causes**:
    
    - Certificate not associated with any account
        
- **Security Use Case**:
    
    - Track failed smart card logons or potential spoofing attempts
        

---

### **4776 - The domain controller attempted to validate credentials**

- **Triggered When**: A logon attempt using NTLM credentials is made.
    
- **Key Fields**:
    
    - `Workstation Name`
        
    - `Account Name`
        
- **Security Use Case**:
    
    - Audit NTLM usage (often discouraged)
        
    - Catch use of weak, outdated protocols
        

---

### **4777 - The domain controller failed to validate the credentials**

- **Triggered When**: An NTLM logon attempt fails.
    
- **Security Use Case**:
    
    - Track brute-force attempts
        
    - Monitor outdated apps still using NTLM
        

---

## üö´ **Access Control Policy Enforcement**

---

### **4820 - A Kerberos TGT was denied due to access control restrictions**

- **Triggered When**: A device or user tries to obtain a TGT but is blocked by policies (e.g., Conditional Access, device compliance).
    
- **Security Use Case**:
    
    - Enforce Zero Trust policies
        
    - Detect non-compliant or rogue devices
        
    - Validate effectiveness of group/device policies

## üìä **Correlating Events in SIEM or Detection Rules**

To build detection or monitoring pipelines:

| Correlation Logic             | Alert Type                     |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Multiple **4771** from one IP | Brute-force or password spray  |
| Rare **4769** SPNs requested  | Recon/lateral movement         |
| **4773** ‚Üí **4769** patterns  | Unauthorized service access    |
| Many **4820** from same host  | Device compliance issues       |
| **4775** without 4774         | Smart card misconfig or misuse |
| Excessive **4777**            | NTLM brute-force attempts      |
