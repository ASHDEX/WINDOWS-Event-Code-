## **Object Access Events**

### **4661: A handle to an object was requested**

- Indicates an application or user requested access to an object such as a file, registry key, or Active Directory object.
    
- **Use Case:** Identifying attempts to access sensitive files or registry settings, useful in threat hunting and forensic investigations.
    

### **4662: An operation was performed on an object**

- Logged when specific operations (like read, write, delete, modify permissions) are performed on an Active Directory object or other secured objects.
    
- **Use Case:** Monitor unauthorized changes or access attempts to critical AD objects or resources.

## **Active Directory Replication Events**

### **4928: An Active Directory replica source naming context was established**

- Logged when replication begins between Domain Controllers (DCs).
    
- **Use Case:** Monitor the start of replication events, ensuring DC synchronization is functioning normally.
    

### **4929: An Active Directory replica source naming context was removed**

- Logged when replication between DCs is terminated.
    
- **Use Case:** Tracking termination or disconnection of replication activities.
    

### **4930: An Active Directory replica source naming context was modified**

- Logged when changes occur in replication parameters/settings.
    
- **Use Case:** Monitoring and auditing configuration changes in AD replication setup.
    

### **4931: An Active Directory replica destination naming context was modified**

- Similar to 4930, but refers to destination context parameters during replication.
    
- **Use Case:** Audit configuration or policy changes at the replica destination level.
    

### **4932: Synchronization of a replica of an Active Directory naming context has begun**

- Indicates synchronization initiation between DCs.
    
- **Use Case:** Verify regular synchronization intervals, investigate replication delays or anomalies.
    

### **4933: Synchronization of a replica of an Active Directory naming context has ended**

- Indicates synchronization has successfully concluded.
    
- **Use Case:** Track completion of AD replication, useful in performance monitoring and troubleshooting replication issues.
    

### **4934: Attributes of an Active Directory object were replicated**

- Logged when attributes from an object are replicated between DCs.
    
- **Use Case:** Validate that AD attributes synchronize correctly, monitor specific attribute-level replication.
    

### **4935: Replication failure begins**

- Indicates the onset of replication issues.
    
- **Use Case:** Quickly identify and respond to AD replication issues.
    

### **4936: Replication failure ends**

- Indicates the resolution of previous replication errors.
    
- **Use Case:** Confirm successful troubleshooting of replication issues.
    

### **4937: A lingering object was removed from a replica**

- Logged when a stale or outdated AD object (lingering object) is removed during replication cleanup.
    
- **Use Case:** Track cleanup actions during replication troubleshooting, useful for maintaining AD hygiene.

## **Directory Service Object Events**

### **5136: A directory service object was modified**

- Logged when attributes of AD objects (e.g., users, groups, OUs) are modified.
    
- **Use Case:** Auditing critical changes to objects, ensuring compliance, tracking unauthorized changes.
    

### **5137: A directory service object was created**

- Indicates creation of new AD objects.
    
- **Use Case:** Monitor unauthorized or suspicious creation of objects, useful in insider threat detection.
    

### **5138: A directory service object was undeleted**

- Logged when deleted objects are restored in Active Directory.
    
- **Use Case:** Auditing AD object recovery activities, essential in forensic investigations or accidental deletions.
    

### **5139: A directory service object was moved**

- Indicates objects moved within Active Directory (e.g., user moved to different OU).
    
- **Use Case:** Monitor organizational restructuring, unauthorized moves of sensitive objects, or malicious activities.
    

### **5141: A directory service object was deleted**

- Logged when an object in Active Directory is deleted.
    
- **Use Case:** Crucial for auditing, identifying accidental or malicious deletions, tracking potential sabotage.
    

### **5169: A directory service object was modified**

- Specifically logged during modifications of directory service-related objects during operations or maintenance tasks.
    
- **Use Case:** Auditing changes that affect service-specific AD configurations or policies.
    

### **5170: A directory service object was modified during a background cleanup task**

- Indicates automated maintenance or cleanup changes to AD objects.
    
- **Use Case:** Understanding AD internal housekeeping tasks, differentiating between administrative and automated operations.

## **Security & Monitoring Recommendations**

- **Enable Auditing:** Ensure auditing for the listed events is configured properly in your AD environment.
    
- **Correlation and SIEM Integration:** Forward logs to your SIEM solution (like Splunk, Azure Sentinel, or Elastic SIEM) for effective monitoring and proactive threat detection.
    
- **Establish Baselines:** Regularly review logs to establish baselines and quickly identify deviations indicative of suspicious activities.
    
- **Periodic Review:** Routinely audit these events for security and operational integrity
